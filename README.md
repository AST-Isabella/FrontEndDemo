# FrontEndDemo is the code for a web app to demonstrate our idea for a mobile app which contributes to social justice.
# The app will help increase consumer awareness of the varying social responsibility of businesses they may patronize.
# We are UTD students participating in Hacks for Humanity and we have very little experience coding web apps and mobile apps.
# Future possibilities for this project include a cross-platform mobile app, SQL database back end, non-profit sponsorship
